# The German Ghost
### A Beginner JavaScript Game

He is a ghost and he is trapped, destined to float around inside the parameters of a map for eternity. When you come to visit, he gets both excited and a little shy. That's why he doesn't say much, unless you find the secret spots on the map where he's hidden quotes from Rammstein songs. Explore the map according to the instructions below and keep the German ghost company for a while, he will greatly appreciate it. At least as long as you don't click on him!

## Instructions

Explore the map by moving the ghost around using either the arrow keys on your keyboard or `A` (left), `S` (down), `D` (right) and `W` (up). If a questionmark appears above the ghost's head, press `enter` to reveal the hidden quote. Press `T` for a translation to Swedish. Also, in a spot with no questionmark present, try pressing the `spacebar` on your keyboard and see what happens.

### Will you find all of the quotes?
